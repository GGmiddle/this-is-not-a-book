Every part of human society defines itself through alienation. Like
baboons separating into angry packs, the only thing that prevents us
from clawing apart our kin is the shared communal catharsis of rage
against an enemy—an outsider—which does not belong. We are who we are
because we are a part of this group and not that one. For that to work,
each group needs to define itself and the only way to do that is to
alienate the outliers until a clear uniformity emerges.

The human animal, in aggregate, is quite intolerant of variation.

Civilised as we are, we no longer do this with teeth and clubs but
through rhetoric and ideology.

This is the reason why it does not matter whether Clayton Christensen’s
theory of Disruptive Innovation is true or not. It doesn’t matter if it
can be tested. There is little point in debating its flaws. It has
become a shibboleth—the code word that tells us whether you are with us
or against us. Debates on the theory are nothing more than the clubs and
claws of warring paradigms and will net us nothing but pain and
conflict.

What publishing and media are going through is a paradigm shift. Akin to
a religion, each paradigm is a worldview, conceptual framework, and
theory of practice all wrapped into one. Switching from one to another
is not achieved through reason and debate but through revelation and
apostasy.

This isn’t a question of changing your mind but of feeling your old god
die in your heart as it is strangled by the new god. You can sometimes
change a person’s mind but a wholesale transformation of a worldview is
a place people have to walk to themselves.

Faith abides and is not subject to reason. Shattering faith to replace
it is always an act of violence, even when it is self-inflicted.
