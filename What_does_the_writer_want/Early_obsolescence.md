**All digital projects are going to be obsolete with the next (OS, new
technology), so we’re not going to bother until we can be sure this
isn’t a flash in the pan.**

Oh come on. This one rears it’s head every few years. There’s some
validity to it (as above) but no-one ever wrote a book without a plan
for reprints, or an acceptance that it might be remaindered or disappear
from stock . The same approach ought to be true of digital projects, but
all too often manifests as an extension of *[Digital is Expensive](/What_does_the_writer_want/Expensive.html)*, or,
*Fear*. Yes, OSes are going to evolve, and new features and
technological jiggery-pokery are sometimes going to cause you a problem.
Most of the time though, this is solvable without breaking the bank.
There are also alternatives to apps. HTML5, run natively through a
website, is not going to suffer the same upgrade issues as a bespoke
App, and be considerably more flexible in the process. There are some
things that demand an app - a contained experience, GPS driven content,
using specific hardware features of a mobile device, but if that’s the
case, then your project ought to be considered in those terms too.
