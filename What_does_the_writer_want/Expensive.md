Bullshit. Digital can be expensive, and digital projects made without a
clue to the reasons you’re making them are almost certainly going to be
expensive, because developers have to live too. If you don’t tell
someone exactly what you want, or learn to talk to them about what that
is, then you’re going to be paying through the nose. Digital isn’t
inherently expensive though. Certainly no more expensive than your time
is when you’re writing, and definitely cheaper than a hoarding on the
side of a bus, or in a tube station. Suggesting that the imagined
expense of digital is a barrier to even starting is cobblers, and
cowardice. A book needs to be in print, be warehoused, shipped and
promoted. Even an eBook needs editing, designing and maintenance, and
we’re all capable of doing those things.
