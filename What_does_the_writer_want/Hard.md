This one isn’t without merit - knowing what you want, how to achieve it,
and avoiding the pitfalls isn’t going to be easy, but neither is writing
a novel. A combination of techniques, practices and persistence will get
you a long way. Digital is hard when you overstretch, when you reach for
the moon, or throw everything and the kitchen sink at something (see the
next chapter for some of this). It’s significantly less hard when you
try to do one thing well, maybe two, and work hard at learning how to
get those things right.
