**Digital is choose-your-own-adventure / open-ended / transmedia /
insert-your-own-cliche.**

First of all, see [the earlier essay](/What_does_the_reader_want/Choose_your_own_adventure.html).
Digital can be all of those things, but it needn’t be. If you want to
create one of those formats, then go for it - you’ll learn a huge amount
by doing, and trying, and falling flat on your arse halfway through.
Digital can be subtle though, it can toy with little aspects of
expectation and familiarity. It can pull the rug out from under our
feet, just as Orson Welles’ *War of the Worlds* did, or *The Blair Witch
Project*. Big ideas that come down to tiny adjustments in the rules of
storytelling. It can be books, augmented by digital trickery, it can be
difficult structures that require a wall full of post-it notes to make
sense of while writing.

Digital can be a notebook, and a pen and an idea. It begins, as all good
work does, with a spark of imagination; a ‘what-if’ that demands to be
answered by unconventional means.
