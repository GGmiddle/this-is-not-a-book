Writers aren’t born finished. Great works of entertainment don’t emerge
ex nihilo, rather they are worked in utero, Many hands and minds
contribute, either in the development, the writing itself, or the
editing and assembly of a work. That is true to a lesser of greater
extent with most literature, but is critically important when
considering digital projects. Writing is a craft that is learned by
doing. Finishing things, moving on the next and continually honing your
mental muscles. While we’ve tried to puncture a few myths, one that
remains true is that this field is very rarely one that can be addressed
by a single individual, working alone. At some stage, you’re going to
have to talk to someone else.

Blessed isolation and the writer’s life are going to part company.

If this is making you nervous, then take a deep breath before you read
on. It isn’t going to get worse, but you’re going to have to come to
terms with letting go of your work and trusting other people. You might
be, and we stress *might* here, one of those very lucky people who’s
talents take them many directions at once. You might be able to code, to
design for user experiences, to produce a technically complex project of
which the writer is but one (albeit pretty important) part. The
likelihood though, is that you aren’t that individual and that if they
do exist, then they’re so rare that Maharajas will pay explorers a
chessboard’s worth of grain to find them. You’re also not going to find
them, or the gang of them that you need to get to know, by placing an
advert in the post office, virtual or otherwise.
