We believe every word we’ve written here. Especially the short ‘What is
a digital book?’ section in the previous chapter. The biggest mistake
you can make is thinking of digital projects as books. They are not -
from the manner of their reading, the platform on which they’re read,
the means of their creation and especially their commissioning and
curation. Your business is built on a combination of measured risk,
paranoia and pessimism countered with an unhealthy dose of unbridled
self-belief and optimism. It has survived for so long because what you
manufacture is genuinely valuable and your processes - as laboured and
ground-in to your entire business as they are - work toward producing
those precious paper and board objects that keep the whole wheel
turning.

You have to change those processes if you’re going to work with digital
writing. No-one in their right mind believes that the same production
process will work in film as for publishing, so why would you try to
shepherd a digital project to completion using identical processes as a
conventional book? Sales forecasts, costs, returns on investment and
justifications all need to be rewritten. Just as we’ve asked writers to
know what it is they want from a digital project, we’re asking you too.
Why do you want to pivot your business to a new market? So far, you’ve
done an admirable job reengineering physical books as digital
facsimiles, but the tone of the conversation has to shift, and is
shifting toward what the medium is capable of. You are more than
intermediaries in the creative process - you enable it and you support
and nurture it - we’d like to explain some things though.
