Digital isn’t a part of the traditional print environment—it lies
adjacent to print, surrounds, frames and comments on it, but it isn’t a
part of it.

But, *print is a part of the digital environment*.

The separation between the two is entirely a construct of the print
ecosystem. When you sit in the print worldview, websites look like
something amorphous—form without either form or a business model. It
doesn’t just look shapeless and disorganised, most of it *literally*
just looks like noise to print people: meaningless and random.

When you sit in the networked media worldview, what you see is fluidity
and meaningful change. Instead of explicit structure you have explicit
connections that imply structure. It isn’t amorphous but [loosely
coupled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) and, yes, a little
bit messy.

(And of course, from this perspective the print world looks stiff, unyielding, and full of meaningless busy-work so incomprehension of the other paradigm very much goes both ways.)

Because the networked worldview is all about loose coupling and
adaptation to changing environments, print is a first class citizen.
Print books can be made that only make sense in a networked context.
Websites can be made that only make sense if you have a print book.
Print books can interoperate with digital through scanning or even
simple references. Print meaning can become a part of digital meaning as
photographed pages or as contextual discussion. Books can be designed
and created through a process that is [fundamentally
web-based](http://www.princexml.com/). It is the default behaviour of
objects in a network to make connections whether they are physical
objects or virtual or virtual representations of physical object acting
as a proxy for the material form.

The network’s trump card is the fact that its worldview offers a clearer
path towards solving the problems facing modern book production, both
print and digital. From the print perspective each format has to go through an expensive and involved production pipeline. It doesn’t matter if its
a hardcover, paperback, or an ebook, they all have to pass through the
same sort of error-prone, inflexible, and slow pipeline: Editing &rarr;
Design &rarr; Typesetting &rarr; Proofing &rarr; Distribution.

(It's error-prone because it tries to catch all errors in advance, which is impossible, but at the same time its extended production pipeline makes every error catastrophic and unfixable. The print pipeline magnifies errors.)

From the networked perspective all representation is dynamic and all
content is fluid. Removing the adaptability of digital media without
giving something in return is an act of violence, not just towards the
piece of content itself, but towards *the reader*. Baking a website into
a static digital file that only works on tablets is an act of violence
towards readers who don’t have tablets or have needs that don’t conform
to the expectations you baked into the fixed layout ebook.

Conversely, rendering a dynamic work into printed form isn’t an act of
violence, provided that it was a part of the work's design, because you get something artful in return: a crafted object.

Some dynamic works don't lend themselves to linearity, like hypertexts, but it's a less of an act of violence to turn them into print than into ebooks. Print is simultaneously a medium, furniture, and a souvenir. It has value beyond its content while ebooks are a barely adequate delivery system for content with little value in and of themselves. Print's inherent value partially makes up for the violence of forcing linearity on non-linearity, especially when you consider that print enables more non-linearity than ebooks. Flipping back and forth in a book is easier in print and less confusing than in current ebooks.

The art of the book as an object becomes *more* important in the
networked world, not less, because that’s the role it plays in the
larger networked picture—the value it brings to the table. Print is the souvenir—abstract ideas turned into display and furniture. It becomes a way of turning the implicit and unreal into something concrete and, yes, decorative.

Print production in the networked worldview is an iterative and fluid process, more
like sketching than the industrialised process of the print worldview.
Print-ready PDFs can be rendered at every stage of writing, editing, and
proofing. You can order one-off copies of your book on a whim using
services like [Blurb](http://www.blurb.com/) and you can order those
copies *whenever you want*, without asking anybody permission. It’s all
just between you and your credit card issuer. If you’ve self-published
an ebook you can order a single hardcover copy to give to your
non-digital grandmother—provided you’ve used tools built in the
networked worldview where both an ebook and a print-ready PDF is only a
button press away.

Or you could do what me and my sister did and create a one off coffee table book of your grandmother's life and give it to her for her birthday.

The print worldview dismisses the network’s intrusions into print as
being of a lower quality than what the print worldview’s processes
create.

But they are lying to themselves when they make that comparison because
they are comparing on the one hand their process which is built on
hard-earned, expensive, and rare expertise—people who can do this work well are few and their rates are high—and the digital process which is admittedly mediocre but is *consistently* mediocre and predictable and, as time goes by, needs less and less skill to operate. (That's provided you are doing it right, which a lot of people aren't.)

Expert typesetting varies because experts vary. For every master
designer you have a dozen rubbish InDesign operators churning out PDFs
that make PrinceXML’s output look like bloody [Robert
Bringhurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Typographic_Style).

The networked worldview is already better at solving the problems print
is facing than the print worldview itself. The network has much
greater untapped resources for solving what so far has looked
unsolvable.
