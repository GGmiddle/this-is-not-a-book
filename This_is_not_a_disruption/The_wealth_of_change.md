Much as in the sciences, when you stop wasting your time on defending your paradigm, when you stop having to build your field from scratch in every debate, a wellspring of time and energy opens up for you to tap into.

There isn't much point in trying to talk somebody out of a firmly held belief. A person's worldview isn't up to debate. And that's what we are dealing with: paradigms, worldviews, beliefs. We aren't talking about sports where, no matter what you think about the players, the winner is the winner and the loser is the loser. Debate the qualities of each team but, if they won, they won. You can't talk a person out of their perspective on the world no matter how many points you score.

Take it from someone who has played that game for too long: sometimes you just have to preach to the choir. Don't evangelise; the choir has heard it all already. Don't preach; the believers don't need converting.

The only constructive thing to do is to focus on the practice—the work. Try and figure out better ways to make and create. Let the work itself do the preaching and evangelising.

Stop wasting your time debating people who are never going to agree with you. The energy you free up can be spent on better things. But even if you can spare the time and energy, the risks and price of sparring with ideologues is often higher than you think.

## Don't be framed!

Here's a mistake I keep making and, hopefully, by documenting it I can avoid repeating it.

Maybe you're familiar with this sequence of events:

1. A pundit or blogger writes something outrageously wrong or something that completely misrepresents something important to you—your profession or field of study.

2. You write a response.

3. The pundit's reply either completely ignores what you said—often using it a springboard to make a completely different point or as an excuse to criticise you personally—or they misrepresent everything you said in a manner that supports their agenda.

4. Repeat steps 2. and 3. until you are furious.

5. *You* then get dismissed and branded as the irrational and angry crank who is always on the attack and response to reasonable discussions with fury.

6. Bonus points if you're a woman or a minority and who then gets branded by the pundit (very 'politely') as one offensive stereotype or another.

Note: the provocateur pundit always *always* maintains a level of civility, tone, and politeness that's higher than the baseline of the community they are participating in. That's how they get away with writing outrageous and offensive nonsense.

This is a *no win* situation because the pundit controls the frame of the discussion. The *point* of the instigating post is to strengthen the pundit's ideological base—cement their position within the community that holds their worldview. It is very much an intentional trap and the only solution is to not fall for it.

Occasionally, especially on Twitter, you will find the pundit using a slightly different setup to this routine. The cycle isn't triggered by a post but by the pundit coming in with an innocent question—often one that's either a bit strange or out of the left-field. You answer, and before you know it, you've been pulled into a cycle of nonsense where the pundit is trying to brand you as a troll, crank, or madman in front of their chosen community.

No good comes from engaging with these people.



\[And this. The point is that debating print paradigm people is utterly
pointless.\]
