A map is not a plan of city streets, with markers for churches, post
offices and traffic signals. It can be that, of course, but your map is
a space is personal. It’s a collection of smells and sights and sounds
that’s triggered every time you re-enter that space, or go somewhere
like it.

Each one of your readers has their own map, their own shorthand
for streets, plazas, rivers, and they have gps maps to find their way
there in the first place. What the relationship between their map, yours
and the journey they’re going to make is we can’t tell you, but we’d
suggest it’ll be more trigger-led than co-ordinates.
