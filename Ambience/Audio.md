Almost finally; sound. The simplest form of immersion, and potentially
the most effective. Sound - delivered through headphones or played by
speakers that interrupt the wild track of the city - directs the
attention like no other medium in this field. Video is invasive, and
obscures with an obvious frame (we’ll amend this chapter when
GoogleGlass II is available, and works, and doesn’t make you look like a
dork), and sound operates in 360 degrees, not a 20/20 field. Binaural
sound spatially transcends stereo, allowing a writer/designer the
opportunity to create a genuinely immersed experience.

write with sound - we begin sketching our pieces with short fragments of
audio that establish a mood, amending and amended by the impact of space
and the journey (even as bare, non-specific points to cross through),
that then provide a scaffold to rebuild the audio for the final piece.
We return to those sketches for new works, or reinvent them with fresh
arrangements that better suit the genre and tone we’re aiming for, but
it’s sound that starts and ends a process.
