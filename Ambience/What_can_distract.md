Nothing, and everything, on a spectral scale. It really depends on how
closely you mask the world (also see *audio*, below). There’s nothing
wrong in designing something that operates as a heritage tour: directing the reader’s attention to things, explaining them and focusing
them exactly where you want them to be. But it’s like being inside an
Occulus Rift, suffocating, with an absence of peripheral vision, and no
awareness of the real stuff around you. If you want to write VR,
then write VR.

The value in digital’s relationship to reality is that it
can abstract it away as needed. It can draw the eye (or the ear, or the
hand) in as required, and bring everything down to the detail of a chalk
mark on a wall, and it can zoom back out to the whole panorama. Weather
is going to distract, but since that’s a given, we’d suggest you ignore
it. The time of day is your friend though—the same piece experienced
in daylight and at dusk might as well be in two completely different
locales.
