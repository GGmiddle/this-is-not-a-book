The ubiquity of digital media shouldn’t be taken to mean that always-on
is a problem, or that your job is to shut out the world around the
reader in order that they only focus on the thing you’re showing them.
Since the world is there, isn’t it more productive to focus the reader’s
attention out - to the city around them in all it’s complexity, but
mediated by the story you’re taking them through? You cannot shut the
world out; it won’t let you.
