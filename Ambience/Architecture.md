Look up. Look at every facade, and each piece of decoration, each tiny
detail. Now ignore them. Instead, focus on the shapes of the buildings
in front of you, behind and around you. What are they made of? Why are
they built the way they are? What’s their history, their purpose. How do
you get inside? Is there a single door, or a double. Revolving?
Security? What does that tell you about what’s inside. What about the
doorway; does anyone sleep in it? If so, is there a trace of them the
next day? What is the pavement made of? The road?

Stanley Kubrick had his nephew, Manuel Harlan, document an entire road
for pre-production on *Eyes Wide Shut*, stitching photographs together
into a 6-meter-long recreation of space in order that his uncle could
decide on camera movements. You don’t need to be *quite* that obsessive,
but you do need to look.
