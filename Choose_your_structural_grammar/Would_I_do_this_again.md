Back when I was a kid in gagnfræðaskóli (the Icelandic equivalent of
high school, literally ‘school for useful studies’) a friend of mine,
pressed for time, wrote a book review essay for school pretending that a
AD&D roleplaying session of his was a fantasy novel.

His teacher had given the class the assignment to review a book of their
own choice. He’d been too lazy to read something so he just gave the
session a title and wrote a literary ‘review’ of it for the class. The
teacher couldn’t tell the difference and none of the kids blabbed.

Much ink (and pixels) has been spilled on the issue of the role of
storytelling in games. There’s always been a narrative element to games
but the use and importance of stories in games exploded in the late 20th
century. Even without computer games, roleplaying games, board games
with an explicit and important setting and back story, and
choose-your-own-adventure books make the issue complicated enough on
their own.

That a medium like games can accommodate and use narrative elements but
not be dependent on them seems to break the brains of a lot of
academics, despite the fact that this is the role that stories tend to
play in at least two other historically important art forms:

-   Poetry? Can use stories and story-like elements but doesn’t need
    them as a form.
-   Music? Ditto.

Of course, this complicates all attempts to define a theory of games. Is
it a good game when you’re just using the mechanics of the form to
deliver a story? Is it a good game if the story is rubbish but does an
excellent job of serving the gameplay? How many angels can dance on the
head of a pin?

Asking if something is a good game or novel is only a useful question if
you’re an academic or an annoying snob. You can take that question and
its siblings (such as *did this conform to the rules of its form as
academics define them?*), put them in a box, and throw them in a
particularly indigestive volcano. They don’t help you create. They don’t
help you create.

The questions to ask are more along these lines:

-   How did this affect me?
-   Was the experience consistent?
-   Did it play with or too my expectations in an interesting way?
-   *Would I do this again?*

Anybody who has spent any time researching readers and players knows
that these four qualities—effect, consistency, expectations, and
repeatability—are what is important to them about works of art.

When it comes to deciding on a medium or genre as a creator, how those
four qualities play out and support or don’t support our goals and
intentions is the single most important factor to consider.
