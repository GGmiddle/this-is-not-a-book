The novel has a longer history than people expect. How long, exactly, is
a bit more complicated to answer because then you have to start defining
exactly what a novel is in terms of length, style, and structure.

We’ve clearly been telling stories in prose for millennia but even if we
restrict ourselves to something more specifically novelistic in terms of
structure and style then we’re still talking about more than [a thousand
years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji).

(Who’s with me on holding a party in 2021 celebrating the thousand year
old birthday of the published novel?)

This is something we’ve clearly been doing for a while.

Despite this extended history, prose never really took off as a method
for telling long stories. It dominated non-fiction, philosophy, and
theological studies, sure, and it was the primary form of telling really
short stories like fairy tales, fables, and ghost stories.

But when it came to telling longer interconnected stories poetry was
what most storytellers reached for: Gilgamesh; Homer’s Iliad and
Odyssey; Ovid’s Metamorphoses; Virgil’s Aeneid; Beowulf; Poetic Edda;
Dante’s Divine Comedy; Ariosto’s Orlando Furioso; Milton’s Paradise
Lost; Byron’s Don Juan; Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin.

Prose stories and novels existed but they have been in the storytelling
minority for most of their history—even many of the exceptions relied
heavily on poetry. Most of The Canterbury Tales are in verse. Even the
Prose Edda was written and presented as a textbook for poets—it isn’t
strictly speaking intended to be a prose retelling of the Norse myths.
It was a Christian-era explanation of norse myths so that contemporary
poets could read and use the metaphors, idioms, and similes that were
based on those old myths. Drama and poetry ruled the storytelling roost.

(On a tangental note: what the Prose Edda omits, elides, and adds is
just as interesting as the retelling itself. If you compare the Poetic
to the Prose Edda, it seems clear that Snorri Sturluson adjusted the
myths a bit to suit the more Christian culture of his day. For example,
you can read the Poetic Edda as saying that Freyja ruled over the armies
of Valhalla with Odin—that she, as the viking feminine ideal, was a lot
more warlike than the Christian retellings made her out to be. Make love
AND war, instead of make love, not war. The idea that the viking goddess
of love would be a passionate general appeals to me.)

It wasn’t until moveable type became the norm that the novel began to
make headway and even then poets like Byron and Pushkin dominated the
scene with what were essentially novels in verse.

It isn’t that printed poetry doesn’t work. It does. It’s that poetry
isn’t reliant on print, as a form it works just as well orally as
it does printed.

Oral transmission coupled with the mnemonic aids of verse makes poetry
less dependent on print for distribution and authorship.

But…

*Novels needed print to thrive as a medium.*

Print distribution put novel distribution and dissemination on an even
level with poetry. But even with a more even playing field it took the
novel many years to reach parity and then surpass poetry as the western
world’s primary form of written storytelling.
