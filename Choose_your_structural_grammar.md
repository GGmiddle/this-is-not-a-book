My dad has regularly been going to the theatre for decades. He and a few
of his friends have a subscription at Þjóðleikhúsið and, come rain, come
shine, every few weeks they go to see whatever it is that they’re
staging. It doesn’t matter if it’s getting awful reviews, whether it’s a
farce or a tragedy, they go, watch, and then talk about it over wine.
This tradition has survived two divorces and several major career
changes.

Theatre has that effect on people (especially if you fancy yourself as a
cultured middle-class citizen of the world). People get hooked on
watching it. People get hooked on working in it. Theatre isn’t a
mainstream hobby activity but it’s here to stay.

It is, arguably, the oldest form of storytelling that we still practice.
(The other contender being music, although given how intertwined drama
and music have been, the distinction is moot.)

Speak to any historian of cinema (especially the amateur ones) and
you’ll get a yarn about how early cinema consisted just of a camera
pointing at a stage: recorded plays that didn’t use the medium to any
sensible degree and that film didn’t begin to advance until filmmakers
began to break away from the conventions of the stage.

This narrative—even though
[it’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Seen_Through_a_Telescope)
[demonstrably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FrdVdKlxUk),
[completely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impossible_Voyage),
[and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winsor_McCay#Animation_.281911.E2.80.931921.29)
[utterly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers_Leaving_the_Lumi%C3%A8re_Factory)
[untrue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_That_Jack_Built_(1900_film))—has
become a standard trope in media commentary.

Right out of the gate, early cinema focused on spectacle, fantasy, and
documentary works. Most of the stage adaptations come *after* the
special effects and documentary films. The crude and stage-bound nature
of early film has more to do with the limitations and immobility of the
cameras than an over-bearing influence of drama on the filmmakers.

The story that film grew out of remediated stage plays is a fiction.

Even though it *is* a complete fiction, its message is a useful one:
different media have varying qualities. This means that each medium
lends itself more to doing some things over others. It’s a McLuhanite
parable—his pithy ‘the medium is the message’ aphorism writ large as a
largely made up metaphor.

Which is all good. My only problem is that there’s a better yarn we can
use for this: the story of an earlier media evolution that has much
stronger parallels to our current new media predicament.
