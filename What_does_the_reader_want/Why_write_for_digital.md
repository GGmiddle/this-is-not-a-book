Now that’s a question we’re not going to approach an answer for. You
have your reasons - you might anticipate an alternative to linear
narrative, a challenge that’s not been met by the physical book, an
escape from formats and expectations. Your reasons are your own, and
we’d be the last people to inquire after them. What we will say though,
is that to really grasp the nettle of digital technology, you have to
anticipate that this is different. It can be more than a novel in a
digital wrapper. It can be something we’ve not seen yet. Something
exciting. Something risky and something not-of-the-now.

That utopian ideal, though, is our biggest problem. How do we conceive
of something that is so unfamiliar, so not-now that it really addresses
the what-could-be of digital. Here’s another to look at the problem:

Every piece of Science Fiction is addressed through a lens of now. We
cannot avoid this. The techno-utopian ideas of Star Trek are projections
from the 1950s and 60s. Solaris is Russia. Star Wars is the United
States. Writing SF in 2014 without addressing Climate Change in some way
or form is to deny culture.

So it is with writing and reading. Every great leap forward has been
built on what we understand, what we see around us. The CD Rom failed
because it wasn’t *different enough*. DVDs are VHS are cinema in a
portable format. Hypertext is

Now that’s interesting. Hypertext is different. Not so new as we think
(Borges, Bush, Nelson all predate your authors by a few dozen years),
but still a radical step.

What we did with it, though, is largely predictable (link to CYOA
piece). We didn’t really try anything *new*.

To repeat a phrase, that’s our problem. Our brick wall. The fog within
which we make work. So, how do we do things differently? How do we break
out of conventions?
