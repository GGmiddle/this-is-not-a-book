title: "You cannot, and never should, ‘digital’ something for someone"

If some bright spark anywhere, no matter how well paid they are,
suggests that you ‘digital’ a piece of work for them, or a process, then
walk out of the room. Preferably with your dignity intact. Digital work
takes as much thought, as much care, as print, or performance. This
isn’t to say that creating digital versions of pre-existing works is a
bad thing. This rule of thumb is about not working with people who
constantly pronounce the word ‘digital’ with audible quotation marks.
They’re all hell to work with, each of them has their unique and
adorable way of completely fucking up your life. They don’t understand
what they want. They don’t understand what the audience wants. They
don’t understand what you can do. They don’t understand what the work
can do. They are what the platonic ideal of Ignorance aspires to become
when it grows up. So just don’t work with them. Unless, of course, they
offer you a fuck-ton of money which would leave you in the black for the
next six months. If that’s the case, take the money and use it to fund
your actual practice. (Sometimes dignity means not eating canned food
and not living in a cardboard box.)
