What separates the web from other media is that the audience also sit
quite a bit closer to each other. Groups that have something in common
will form a communities on the web. Sometimes a single interest will be
the driver behind many disparate communities. Sometimes they all congeal
into one fandom. They vary, but they all have in common a certain
inevitability: the web is made up of communities.
