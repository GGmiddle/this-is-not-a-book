*For the love of God, use version control and then back it up, offsite.*
It doesn’t have to be a fully fledged Git install. As long as it doesn’t
involve you repeatedly using ‘Save As…’ with an ever-extending filename
suffix (‘-version-15-nice-edit.doc’) it’s fine. Unless, of course, you
are writing code. Then you really should be using a code-oriented
version control system. Like, Git. Too many people have lost too much
work for this to be anything but an utter and total requirement.
