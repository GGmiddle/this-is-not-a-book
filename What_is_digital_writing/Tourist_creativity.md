Constant iteration is a fact of like in digital. Platforms change and if
you don’t keep working, the work will disappear. But that doesn’t mean
you can’t create lasting artefacts out of the process, they just don’t
come at the end (like they do in the print world) because the end in
digital only comes when you’re dead. Create ebooks, print books,
posters, t-shirts, apps, postcards, and prints from the ongoing work.
They’re like the commas and semicolons of the sentence that is the work.
They create space between the iterations and give the audience something
to remember the work by when you’ve finally given up on it and retired
it.
