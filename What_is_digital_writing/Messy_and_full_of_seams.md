Like so many other media, digital writing started out by copying its
predecessors. Academics wrote academic papers and put them on their
homepage. Companies wrote serious company things, copying their mission
statements and brochures, and posted them online.

But it is in the nature of hypertext to bleed together. That’s its
signature feature. Not just links but also aggregation: collections of
text collected, mixed, and represented online. And once the various
texts begin to bleed together, styles, tones, and voices that are
separated by context in print, butt up against each other in digital.
The writing of multiple authors appear together. Casual intrudes upon
the formal. Conversational text is interspersed with the analytical.

This is both inevitable and proper. Don’t judge hypertext by the
standards of print writing. Judge it by its effects on the readers.
