You’re never going to know whether there’s a beautiful idea in there
unless you get to the root of it. Work fast, too. If you’re going to
work in public, you need to give the public something on a regular
basis. Not too regular; nobody cares about the daily output of a high
fibre, all bran diet and nobody will care about your too-regular output.
Its consistency doesn’t matter and it doesn’t matter if it happens
easily and smoothly every day while sitting in your bathroom, reading.
Publish things more often than you’d like—if you aren’t at least
slightly embarrassed by what you put out, you’re waiting too long—but
make sure it’s valuable to your audience. It can be rough but it has to
have value.
