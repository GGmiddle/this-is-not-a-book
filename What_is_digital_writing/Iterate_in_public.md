Make your mistakes in the glare of the spotlight, and you’ll be rewarded
when you hit the right note. That’s horribly glib, and even as I typed
it it sounds like a snake-oil salesman’s pitch, but there’s some truth
in there too. The web is a crowded marketplace, and you’re vying for
attention with social networks, 24 hour news and more distractions than
you can be bothered to find. The Appstores (Apple and Android are both
guilty of this) are a colossal mess in which you’d be hard pressed to
find anything without a Geiger counter and a bloodhound. Online
bookstores are better, but unless you want your work to be read only
when an algorithm dumps you alongside the thing your reader was
*actually* searching for, then be the subject of that first search:
iterate and develop in public.
