You think you know where you’re going? You don’t. You know where you
are, what you’re starting with, and the rest you have to find out. Think
of yourself as walking out over a frozen lake, prodding ahead with a
long and pointy stick. You may know you want to get to the other side
(having goals is a fine thing, very good in moderation like so many
other things) but you definitely don’t know how. Don’t head directly for
the goal, that’s a good way to plummet through the ice and drown in the
waters below. Search for solid ice close to your feet. Accept the fact
that you might have to take the long way around and be open to finding
other things on the way. Be guided by the community around you: pay
attention to the markers they have placed on the ice.
