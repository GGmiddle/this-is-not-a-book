They have little to no practical value for *making* in most cases and
their social role can be easily supplanted by meeting up in a café. As
an exercise, they are pretty pointless. Here, <a href=http://www.watershed.co.uk/ished/news/getting-comfortable-with-change/>with attribution</a>, is Clare
Reddington on innovation:

Hackathons are brilliant ways to focus energy and time and talent, but
they’re part of a process of development, of changing something. They’re
not it alone.

(Back home in Iceland the university departments have a traditional
outing called *vísindaferð*, or ‘science trip’. These trips generally
involves the students visiting a company related to the subject matter
they’re studying. Once there they then proceed to get absolutely
hammered with the employees of said company sharing war stories, past
failures and successes, and embarrassing stories that tell you what the
industry’s culture values. I think all hackathons should be replaced
with ‘science trips’ in the Icelandic style. Everybody would go home
happy and well ‘connected’.)
