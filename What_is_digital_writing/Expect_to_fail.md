Not because failure is a good thing in any way. It sucks. It’s an awful
thing that stops you in your tracks, sucks all of the energy out of you,
throws you in an emotional cycle of doubt and self-recrimination, and
sends you off to the sofa to eat chocolate and watch Parks and
Recreation while you rebuild your emotional energy. It’s horrible and
all of the people who fetishise it are rich bastards who’ve earned
enough money to soothe the pain. Failure *is*, however, unavoidable.
And, once you’ve pulled yourself up from your chocolate binge and
finished all six seasons of Parks and Rec, it is an excellent learning
experience. (But, what do I know? All the stories and songs about
failure I heard while growing up in Iceland involved drowning at sea or
ended with ravens pecking the eyes out of your bloated and abandoned
corpse. Thank $deity there are only so many seasons of Parks and
Recreation to watch.)
