You might not care about them, or you might picture them with your work,
but they’re there. If writing is an act of communication, then you’re
communicating with someone, somewhere. Writing on a digital platform is
no different except insofar that sits quite a bit closer—right on your
screen, next to your draft in progress. Care about your audience (even
if you pretend that you don’t), and find out who they are. Especially if
you’re going to make your process visible.
