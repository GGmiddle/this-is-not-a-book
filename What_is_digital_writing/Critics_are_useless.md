For just the same reason as the ‘faintest idea’ rule above. Just ignore
them. Keep making work. Make it better.

Actually, let’s slice this particular onion a little bit finer. Critics
come in three types:

1.  Professional critics. Largely academics or pundits. As written
    above, largely useless but can be harmful if you annoy one of them
    too much. Avoid.
2.  Audience critics. A reader criticising something they read, pulling
    it apart, finding what did and didn’t work for them. Awesome stuff.
    Totally irrelevant to you. When the work reaches that point, it’s
    their thing, not yours. Don’t mistake author-audience dialogue
    (which is that relationship you have with the community you are a
    part of) with intra-audience discussions. Telling the two apart is
    relatively easy. Don’t be an arse and pretend otherwise.
3.  Peer critics. Another practitioner picking apart how you did things
    and the effects you got. Useful, but both of you need to be in a
    space where you can give and take detailed advice. A lot of people
    don’t know how to give it. A lot of people don’t know how to
    take it.
