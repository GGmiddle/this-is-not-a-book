*No-one else out there has the faintest idea what they’re doing either.*

That’s why these are thumb-rules (*þumalputtareglur!*), not rules-rules.
Know the field. Try things out. Make something, then make it better.
Develop a nose for what people do, not what they say they do. If they’ve
made a lot of work, then they probably know by trial and error what
works for them, and they certainly know their audience, but deep down,
they’re working this out as they go along. As are you. Write, create,
and explore. We can’t tell you the recipe for making this work because
we don’t know. Nobody does.
