This is not a book. But it *is*:

… an old-fashioned hypertext about writing for digital.

… full of notes on digital as an artistic medium.

… not a text that considers digital to be a remediation or dilution of other media.

… a throwback to the days of the early web.

… written by a couple of over-educated opinion-givers. The 'I' in this text could refer to either one of us.

… over 40 000 words of observations you can easily ignore.

… woefully incomplete and still in progress.
