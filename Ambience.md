I’m standing under the arch of Temple Bar, in London, at the edge of
Paternoster Square. St Paul’s Cathedral lifts into the sky behind me,
and I’m not alone. I’m wearing a pair of headphones, which are attached
to my phone. Music, and the narration above, is playing through them and
I’m not in London in 2015, I’m somewhere else. I’ve been transported,
slipped out of the bustle of the capital and my partner and I are in a
shared space, mediated by the technology in our pockets and the sound in
our ears. We stare at each other, lock eyes, and as instructed by the
voice in our heads, one of us walks away.

We have spent a great deal of time so far thinking about what digital
technology does to books. How it can affect the way we write, create and
design, and what experiencing fiction through a digital lens might be.
For a short time, we’d like to turn the lens outward and ask a different
question:

*What impact does exterior space have on writing?*

We cannot ignore the presence of pervasive technology in this, okay,
emerging field. We carry around little devices that connect us to a
digital world. We’re networked into a wider system, and in addition to
linking us and situating our presence (the simplest example is GPS
location), it affords us the opportunity to interrupt our experience -
to record by photograph, by film and by audio, and have those
interruptions become part of our daily experience. We share our
photographs, our tweets and our tiny fragments of the world. All from a
device smaller than a deck of playing cards. Thinner too.

The example that introduces this section is taken from the opening of *a
Hollow Body*. Commissioned by the Museum of London to accompany their
Sherlock Holmes exhibition in 2014/15, it takes the form of an audio
journey through London, taking in the borders of the City of London,
Cheapside, Smithfield and Barbican. *a Hollow Body* announces itself as
a cinematic experience, a soundtrack for the city. *Imagine walking
through a film where you are the main characters; the streets and narrow
alleys of London acting as your cinematic backdrop.* the language used
to situate each participant is deliberately immersive and participatory,
but also acknowledges the role of place in the narrative. Each pair of
participants walk a pre-determined route through the city. Sometimes
together, sometimes alone, and always accompanied by narration and
instruction, by a situated response to the world around them.

It’s useful to think of the writing process here as a set of tools.
There are more than we’re proposing, and those additions are going to be
very specific to *where* your reader is, but here’s a set of starting
points:

-   [Space](Ambience/Space.html)

-   [Architecture](Ambience/Architecture.html)

-   [Maps](Ambience/Maps.html)

-   [What can distract](Ambience/What_can_distract.html)

-   [Audio](Ambience/Audio.html)

-   [Writing](Ambience/Writing.html)

Finally, to return to the title of this short section. *A Literature of
Ambience, or Ambient Literature*? Any emergent field - as Ambient
Literature surely has to be - is going to be difficult to pin down in
terms of exemplars, of works we can point to. Literature that addresses
or makes use of the ambient though, is not in short supply. We’d like to
draw your attention to a few starting points if you want to read
further:

Teju Cole’s *Open City*. Robert MacFarlane’s *The Old Ways* and
*Landmarks*. Iain Sinclair’s *London Orbital*, *Lights out for the
Territory* and *Slow Chocolate Autopsy*. WG Sebald’s *Rings of Saturn*,
and *Austerlitz*. Janet Cardiff’s work can be found here:
