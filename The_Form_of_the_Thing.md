It is possible that we’ve stumbled into a cultural state that devalues the
idea-of-the-book and fetishises the book-as-object.

Let me explain.

What’s happened to paperback sales in the last five years (it’s mid
2015 as I type - this is worth bearing in mind) is, depending on your
position in the industry, either a wholesale cannibalising of paperbacks
by eBooks, a steady, inescapable plateauing of digital sales at the
expense of the physical and a reduction in trade book sales overall, or
something in-between the two.  

What is scary is that the eBook, regardless of what is likely to happen
to platforms (Kindle, Kobo, iBooks), exists as a reduction, a facsimile
of its print forebear. My colleague, and the other voice in this text,
spends a great deal of time troubling technical developers and working
to find solutions to a problem that need not exist.

Obligatory mis-quotation from Nick Cave:

> We are designers  
> We manipulate typography  
> We understand margins and leading  
> But we are tired of all this self serving deceiving  
> Go tell the publishers that we’re leaving.

There’s nothing wrong with digitising books, but there’s a fundamental
mistruth at the heart of the e/print relationship. The book is an
object, and as we’ve suggested in the previous chapter, digital text is
fluid, and can change. A physical book cannot do that.

But we persist in seeing one thing as the other. We write one thing and
accept the imperfections of the surgery to transpose that one thing from
a printed page to a digital screen.

That’s not to suggest that we should stop improving the process.

The book, though, is different. It is a thing that offers possibilities
and potentials that are markedly different to digital.
