The first thing you’ll be told by most people in publishing is that
readers don’t like change. They like what is familiar, what can be
understood easily and doesn’t scare them.  Which is possibly true.  What
is certainly true is that entrenched interests don’t like change. They
like what is familiar, what can be understood easily and doesn’t scare
them.  It’s worth saying that a position of conservativism here isn’t
*necessarily* a bad thing. Industries have been around a lot longer than
you and I based on entirely that foundation - not rocking the boat is a
safe, steady path. But, if we’re going to extend the metaphor, the water
is getting choppy, and there are big fish out there just waiting to be
caught.

Readers do like what is familiar. They like to be told a story - a
little while after her death, a Susan Sontag essay addressed this
point[^1]; she remarks that ‘*A novel is not a set of proposals, or a
list, or a collection of agendas, or an (open-ended, revisable)
itinerary. It is the journey itself – made, experienced and
completed*’[^2]. However, as the title of this book suggests, digital
stories are not *necessarily* novels, and that’s a critical distinction.
If we persist in thinking of them as a novelistic form, in creating them
that way and assessing them against the requirements of the conventional
novel (much more about this later), then we’re going to get nowhere,
very very quickly.  A better course of action might be to ask ourselves
why we write, and why we’re interested in what writing on a digital
platform might be?  

Why do we write? 
-----------------

To communicate an idea. To tell a story. To explain the world.

Because we can’t not write.

[^2]: The whole essay is sublime, perfect and a genuinely must-read for anyone thinking of writing for new platforms and audiences. Know what the territory is, and address it. Especially if you think you can do better.
