Southern Reach's [digital site](http://www.thesouthernreach.com/) is an example of unease and paranoid behaviour. The
decisions you’re invited to take (and their consequences) are made more
tangible by knowledge of VanderMeer's book and its contents; which is not to say
that they don’t make sense without foreknowledge, but southernreach.com
operates in a curious slipstream between Primary and Secondary platform.

Here’s the thing:

If the audience for the digital comprises the potential audience for the
book, then it’s the first platform they find. The task of the website could be proposed therefore as
enticement, to persuade each viewer to part with their money and buy the book – the
goal of the whole exercise. However, that audience don’t have anything
to work with other than the digital content. It also has to function
as the Primary Platform for the period between first click and the
reader’s encounter with the physical book. It’s caught on a high wire
between enticement and exposition and has to face in both directions at
once.

That’s not to say that it isn’t successful. What thesouthernreach.com
shows is how appreciating the edges of genre can provide focus; the act
of defining a new space, the effort that takes, narrows something useful
around it. We pay attention to the world being created. If you’re asked
to work on a Transmedia project then, the first thing to ask is why. Not
why you, but why is is the shape it is? What is being achieved by each
platform? What is the intention of giving this piece of information out
in this way, rather than in a central, authored text? 

What, in short, is the point?
