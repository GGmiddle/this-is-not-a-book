What you read defines you. What’s on your bookshelves is a signal to
houseguests, potential partners, friends or casual acquaintances who’ve
dropped in for tea. A library, however small, is an act of vanity. We
display books, treasure them and show them off to indicate how far we’ve
come as adults.

I do anyway. Don’t invite me round for dinner, unless you want your
shelves examined.

But why do we read? What do we want books for? What might that tell us
about writing for digital?

Here’s a thought to start with. An obvious one, but let’s agree to begin
somewhere.

We read to escape. Books feed our imagination, nourishing the parts of
ourselves that ask for something else, for a more interesting life.
Books show us worlds, and people we can never be. Even if those people
are our own age, or live in the same city we do, the fact of their being
written about lends them an authority we don’t have. We ask that their
stories have a point, and go somewhere, but really; the fact of their
existence is enough.

Unread books, too, exist. Someone much smarter than me said that a book
isn’t a book until it is read, and while there’s some truth in that (a
kind of pre-emptive reification[^1] of the written word), it is true
that books contain the promise of existence too. Someone wrote this
thing that’s sitting on your shelf with a paper bookmark jutting out of
the first chapter. Someone imagined a life and a world and a plot.
You’ll get around to reading about it someday. If you don’t, then your
children will.

If books feed the imagination, then is digital writing any different?
Should we approach creating a digital text any differently than a
conventional novel? Do we need to?

Well, it’s probably no surprise that we think you should. Digital books—when considered as a book—are very different animals to their
printed counterparts. They don’t really exist, for a start. They’re
icons on your tablet, or a filename in an eReader. Maybe an App that’s
in both places. Regardless, they don’t possess the same sort of gravity
that a book does. That book you have with the bookmark poking out of the
pages? You’re going to get around to finishing it, one day. It sits
there and reminds you, every time you dust the shelf, or look for its
neighbour. Its digital cousin doesn’t make the same claim on your
conscience. It can sit there for years and not be noticed. Frankly, that
you only paid pennies for it too, is not going to drag you back to its
pages either. If the digital book doesn’t exist, aside from some disk
space and an icon, then what’s the offer it makes? What drives your
reader to it?

Here’s a partial answer.

It isn’t the desire to finish it.
