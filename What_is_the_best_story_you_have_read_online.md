(Anonymous stories by a retired gay man. Delacour. Dorothea Salo. Fan
fiction, the myth that self-insertion is merely wish-fulfilment, the
shadows of what you are trying to escape follow. Kitten with bloody
paws. Insertion of the same childhood memory. A good story is what
infects, something that spreads through the network like an infectious
fever. What is the best story you’ve read online? I can’t choose. There
are too many.

How do you intentionally catch a fever, build it, make it something that
lasts? How can we take something that is ethereal, ill-defined, and
improvised and capture its essence in a craft of substance?

I’m personally hoping that the answer is practice because, honestly, all
I have to offer in life is practice.)
