To see the present clearly, you need a view of the now and the past that
isn’t obstructed by your hopes, speculations, and dreams about the
future. Seeing the now *requires* the beast’s left eye to be firmly in
your mind.

This isn’t a book about the future of publishing. It isn’t a book that
sets out to examine how we’ve arrived at this point, nor does it propose
any grand solutions for the next few decades. It isn’t about the
challenges for the industry, or the shift to digital.

This book is about now.

This is a collection of provocations masquerading as arguments. Written
by a pair of academics, who are now more usefully engaged in making work
that explores what the book might become in a variety of media and
forms. Each section is intended to be read alone, and the whole
collection to be browsed, dropped in and out of and bookmarked
(digitally or otherwise), commented upon and improved by time.

This book is for writers, artists, designers and programmers. It is for
anyone working with books, with digital technologies, with theatre and
in film. It is for transmedia specialists, experience architects and
everyone else with a brilliant job title. It’s about how we make work.

It is also a manifesto in flux. It is a set of lines in the sand that
will be erased by the next tide and redrawn the following morning
because the world changes everything and you have to believe at least
two things at once.

We thought it was useful to write it though, and have it read.
Collectively or alone. Bookmarked or otherwise. So read it, distribute
it, send it on and excerpt chapters or statements, quotes or ideas.

The world is in flux, and so is writing. As creators in a networked
world, we can sit by the shore and wait for a defining text, watching
the tide for each sighting of a sail on the horizon, or we can write,
and offer ideas, and some of them will find a home.
