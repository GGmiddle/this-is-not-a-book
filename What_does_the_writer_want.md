The first, and possibly the most important question that a creative
individual ought to ask is what do you want from a digital book?

If that answer is an adoring audience, or to be rich, or to get laid,
then put this book down and become a rock star. It’s a hard road, and
you’re going to have to learn to play an instrument (your voice is an
instrument, by the way), but you’ve got about as much chance of
achieving those goals in music as you have in digital books, and the
food is better.

If you want digital to test you, to give you a means of reaching
interested readers, or to create new ways to tell stories, or make
beautiful things, then keep reading.

Before we go any further, we’d like to lay a few myths to rest. They’re
not myths in that they’re imaginary tales of gods and monsters, rather
they’re a Barthesian model of dominant ideology. They’re a third order
of signification that are very rarely challenged, because culture take
the denotation and connotations associated with digital and technology
for granted. Because we don’t take about dominant ideologies, here goes:

- [Digital is expensive](/What_does_the_writer_want/Expensive.html)
- [Digital is hard](/What_does_the_writer_want/Hard.html)
- [Digital gets obsolete](/What_does_the_writer_want/Early_obsolescence.html)
- [Insert digital cliché](/What_does_the_writer_want/Cliches.html)
