# This is the git repo for the "This is not a book" site

The recommended way to make changes if you have access to this repo:

 1. Work on a local copy on your machine using a git client (e.g. Github for Mac).
 2. Commit your changes once you're done with them.
 3. Sync them to this repository.
 4. If everybody is happy with the changes, I'll update the gh-pages branch from the master branch, which makes them live on the website.

If you don't have access to this repo, fork it, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

For any other problem please don't hesitate to file an issue.

***

To preview the site while editing:

1. Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
2. Type `jekyll serve` into the console.
3. Load `http://127.0.0.1:4000` in the browser.

Jekyll is the same tool that Github uses to generate the site.
